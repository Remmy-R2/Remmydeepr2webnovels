# chapter 01: the last harvest

 The rain fell like tears from a dying sky, each droplet carrying the taste of rust and forgotten dreams. 

Li Tian wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his dirt-stained hand, leaving streaks of mud across his weathered face. 

At eighteen, he looked older—the kind of premature aging that came from carrying burdens meant for stronger shoulders.

The farm stretched before him, a patchwork of brown earth and withered hope. Where other properties on the outskirts of New Shanghai buzzed with steam-powered harvesters and mechanical planters, his family's land remained stubbornly analog. The hoe in his hands had belonged to his grandfather, and his grandfather's grandfather before that.

 Its wooden handle was smooth from generations of callused palms, the metal head nicked and scarred but still sharp enough to bite into the unforgiving soil.

He knelt between the rows of struggling vegetables, replanting seedlings that had withered overnight.

 Again. It was the third time this week, and each failed crop meant another day without proper food, another night listening to his grandmother's labored breathing through the paper-thin walls of their ramshackle farmhouse.

"Just grow," he whispered to a particularly pitiful carrot sprout, its leaves yellowed and curled. "Please, just grow."

The irony wasn't lost on him.

 In the distance, the spires of New Shanghai pierced the perpetual smog like gleaming needles, their brass and copper surfaces reflecting the amber glow of a thousand steam engines. 

The city thrived on innovation, on progress, on the marriage of magic and machinery that had redefined civilization. Yet here, barely ten kilometers from that marvel of the modern age, Li Tian couldn't make a simple vegetable survive.

As he worked, his gaze kept drifting to something that shouldn't exist—strange blue veins threading through the soil in the eastern corner of the field. 

They pulsed with a faint luminescence that was only visible when the light hit them just right, like capillaries filled with liquid starlight. 

He'd first noticed them three days ago, right around the time the dreams had started.

Dreams of whispers in languages he didn't recognize. 

Dreams of hands reaching up from beneath the earth, grasping for something just out of reach. 

Dreams that left him waking with dirt under his fingernails and the taste of copper on his tongue.

Li Tian shook his head, dispelling the unwelcome memories.
 Dreams didn't pay for medicine. 
Dreams didn't keep the creditors away. Dreams definitely didn't explain how his grandmother had managed to sit up yesterday for the first time in months, her eyes clearer than they'd been since his parents vanished five years ago.

The thought of his parents sent a familiar pang through his chest. His father, stern but kind, who'd taught him that honest work was its own reward.

 His mother, whose laugh had been like wind chimes in a summer breeze. One day they'd been there, planning the spring planting and arguing about whether to invest in one of those new mechanical tillers.

 The next, their beds were empty, their belongings untouched, as if they'd simply evaporated like morning dew.

The authorities had investigated, of course. Missing persons cases were taken seriously in the shadow of New Shanghai, where corporate espionage and industrial accidents claimed lives with disturbing regularity.

 But the investigation had turned up nothing—no bodies, no signs of struggle, no witnesses. His parents had simply ceased to exist, leaving behind a failing farm, a sick grandmother, and a teenage boy who didn't know the first thing about keeping either alive.

Li Tian stood, brushing dirt from his knees, and surveyed his work.

 The replanted seedlings looked as pathetic as their predecessors, but he'd done what he could. 

Maybe tomorrow would be different. Maybe tomorrow the strange blue veins in the soil would mean something other than his slow descent into madness.

He was turning to head back to the house when a sound stopped him cold—the whisper-soft hum of perfectly calibrated gears, barely audible above the ambient noise of wind and distant city traffic.

 Li Tian's blood chilled. He'd heard that sound exactly once before, three months ago, when a corporate survey team had "accidentally" wandered onto his property while conducting what they'd called "routine environmental assessments."

Routine. The word tasted like ash.

Li Tian dropped into a crouch between the vegetable rows, his heart hammering against his ribs.

 Through the falling rain, he could make out a dark shape descending from the storm-heavy clouds—sleek, angular, moving with the predatory grace of a hunting bird. 

The Iron Covenant logo was barely visible on its hull, a stylized gear wrapped in thorned vines, but he knew it by the sick feeling it triggered in his gut.

The scout mech touched down at the edge of his property with barely a whisper, its landing dampeners absorbing the impact with mechanical precision. It stood roughly three meters tall, humanoid in shape but unmistakably inhuman in its movements. Where a person would shift their weight or adjust their stance, the mech remained perfectly still, a statue of black metal and glowing amber sensors.

For a moment, nothing happened. Li Tian pressed himself lower into the furrows, praying that the rain and gathering dusk would provide enough cover. The mech's head turned with mechanical precision, scanning left, then right, then—

The sensors flared bright orange.

Li Tian's stomach dropped. Whatever the machine was looking for, it had found it. The mech began moving toward the eastern corner of the field, toward the section where the blue veins pulsed beneath the soil like a secret heartbeat.

No. The word echoed through Li Tian's mind with surprising force. Whatever's down there, it's mine. It's all I have left.

He didn't stop to think about the implications of that thought, or why he suddenly felt so possessive of something he didn't understand. Instead, he rose from his hiding place, mud-stained and shaking but determined.

"Hey!" His voice cracked slightly, betraying his fear. "You're trespassing on private property!"

The mech paused, its head rotating toward him with the sound of well-oiled servos. When it spoke, its voice was perfectly modulated, utterly without emotion.

"Civilian detected. This area has been designated for immediate survey under Corporate Mandate 247-C. Please evacuate the premises for your own safety."

"Survey for what?" Li Tian took a step closer, his hands clenched into fists at his sides. "This is my family's land. You have no right—"

"Anomalous energy readings detected," the mech continued as if he hadn't spoken. "Source identified. Beginning extraction."

The machine knelt beside one of the glowing crops—a radish that Li Tian had replanted just that morning. With delicate precision that seemed impossible for something made of metal and wire, it grasped the vegetable by its leaves and pulled.

The radish came free with a sound like tearing silk, trailing luminescent roots that pulsed with blue-white light. But it wasn't just the radish. The entire section of soil began to glow brighter, the network of veins suddenly visible as they spread outward like cracks in glass.

"No!" Li Tian lunged forward without thinking, driven by an instinct he couldn't name. "Put it back!"

The mech's arm moved faster than human eyes could follow, backhanding him across the chest with enough force to lift him off his feet. Li Tian hit the ground hard, the air driven from his lungs in a explosive gasp. Stars danced across his vision as pain flared through his ribs.

But something else flared too—something deeper, hotter, rising from a place he hadn't known existed. As Li Tian struggled to breathe, to think, to make sense of what was happening, the ground beneath the mech began to tremble.

The tremor started small, barely enough to disturb the surface of the puddles forming in the rain. But it grew stronger, more insistent, until the entire field was shaking like a living thing trying to wake from a deep sleep. The mech's sensors swept frantically back and forth, trying to identify the source of the disturbance.

Then the earth split open.

It wasn't a gradual process—no slowly widening crack or gentle subsidence. One moment the ground was solid, the next it gaped like a wound, revealing darkness that seemed to drink in the fading daylight. And from that darkness, impossibly, came a hand.

Not metaphorically. Not symbolically. An actual hand, skeletal and ancient, its bones yellowed with age but somehow still intact. It clutched something—a pendant of some kind, its surface covered in verdigris but still recognizable as jade beneath the corrosion.

The mech's systems shrieked in electronic protest as a pulse of energy erupted from the open grave. Every amber light on its hull flickered and died, leaving it standing silent and motionless in the rain. Even the constant background hum of its power core faded to nothing.

Li Tian pushed himself up on his elbows, staring in horrified fascination at the skeletal hand. As he watched, something impossible happened—the air around the grave began to shimmer, and he could have sworn he heard a voice carried on the wind.

"You... are the last."

The words weren't spoken so much as felt, vibrating through his bones like the echo of some vast bell. Li Tian scrambled to his feet, his pain forgotten in the face of this new impossibility. The last what? The last fool stupid enough to live on a cursed farm? The last person naive enough to believe that honest work could overcome corporate greed?

He was about to voice these questions when something caught the fading light—a glint of crystal embedded in the corpse's ribcage. Without thinking, he took a step toward the grave, then another. The skeletal hand seemed to beckon him forward, its grip on the jade pendant relaxing as if in invitation.

Li Tian knelt at the edge of the pit and reached out with trembling fingers. The crystal was warm to the touch, roughly the size and shape of a playing card but infinitely more complex. Its surface was covered in patterns that seemed to shift and change when he wasn't looking directly at them, geometric designs that hurt his eyes if he stared too long.

The moment his skin made contact with the crystal, it began to dissolve.

Not crumble or shatter—dissolve, like sugar in hot tea. The crystalline substance flowed over his hand like liquid light, soaking into his skin with a sensation somewhere between burning and freezing. Li Tian tried to pull away, but his muscles wouldn't obey. He could only watch in fascination and growing terror as the crystal merged with his flesh, leaving no trace of its passage except a faint tingling that spread up his arm.

Then something flickered in the corner of his vision—a translucent panel that shouldn't exist, glowing softly with amber text.

[System Initializing...]
[Host Identified]
[Spiritual Signature: Purity 99.9%]
[Primordial Codex: ACTIVATED]

Li Tian's vision exploded into light and data, streams of information flowing across his awareness like water through a broken dam. He could see the mech in perfect detail despite its systems being offline—every joint, every servo, every potential point of failure highlighted in blues and reds and amber. He could see the pattern of its movement protocols, the weight distribution that would telegraph its next action, the exact angle required to disable its primary motivators.

How did he know any of this? He'd never seen the inside of a machine more complex than a hand-crank well pump. Yet the information was there, as clear and certain as his own name.

Behind him, the mech's systems came back online with a sound like breaking glass. Amber lights flared to life along its hull as emergency protocols engaged, trying to make sense of what had just happened. Li Tian turned to face it, and for the first time since the machine had landed, he wasn't afraid.

"Warning," the mech announced, its voice slightly distorted by whatever had interrupted its systems. "Anomalous readings have intensified. Initiating suppression protocols."

The machine's arm reconfigured itself with mechanical precision, plates sliding apart to reveal the business end of an energy weapon. Li Tian had seen similar devices in the corporate security footage that occasionally made it onto the public broadcasts—weapons designed to pacify rioters and discourage corporate espionage. Supposedly non-lethal, though the distinction seemed academic when faced with their business end.

The weapon began to charge with a sound like singing crystal, amber light building in its focusing chamber. Li Tian's new awareness painted targeting vectors across his vision, showing him exactly where the mech would aim, exactly when it would fire, exactly how fast he would need to move to avoid incineration.

The problem was, he'd never moved that fast in his life.

But his body seemed to have different ideas about what was possible. As the weapon discharged, Li Tian found himself diving left with inhuman speed, the energy beam passing through the space where he'd been standing with enough heat to char the air. He rolled, came up running, and his hand closed around the first weapon he could find—his grandfather's hoe, still lying where he'd dropped it when the mech first appeared.

The tool felt different in his hands. Heavier, somehow, but also more substantial. More real. Blue light began to flicker along its surface, following the grain of the wood and highlighting every nick in the metal blade.

Li Tian didn't understand what was happening to him, but he understood one thing with crystal clarity: the mech was between him and his home, between him and his grandmother, and he would be damned if he let it take the only family he had left.

The machine fired again, tracking his movement with mechanical precision. This time Li Tian didn't just dodge—he charged, using his new awareness to predict the weapon's targeting pattern. The energy beam scorched the ground beside him as he closed the distance, raising the hoe like a sword.

The blade connected with the mech's leg joint in a shower of sparks and shrieking metal. Li Tian felt the impact travel up his arms, but instead of jarring him to the bone as it should have, the blow felt perfectly balanced, perfectly controlled. The hoe's edge, charged with whatever energy was flowing through him, parted the mech's armor like paper.

Hydraulic fluid sprayed across the muddy ground as the machine's leg buckled. The mech tried to compensate, tried to bring its weapon to bear, but Li Tian was already moving. Another strike, this one aimed at the power coupling beneath the machine's arm. Sparks flew as circuits shorted and the energy weapon went dark.

The mech crashed to its knees, systems failing in cascade patterns that Li Tian could somehow read like text. He raised the hoe for what he knew would be the killing blow—

"Retreat! Retreat!" The voice came from inside the machine, transmitted through speakers that crackled with interference. "Unknown hostile encountered! Request immediate backup!"

The mech's remaining systems engaged emergency protocols, flooding its damaged leg actuators with stimulants and override commands. It managed to rise unsteadily to its feet, weapon arm hanging useless at its side, and began a shambling retreat toward the edge of the property.

Li Tian stood in the rain, watching it go, the hoe still glowing faintly in his hands. Part of him wanted to pursue, to finish what had been started. But a larger part was simply grateful to be alive.

As the mech's form disappeared into the storm clouds, Li Tian became aware of another presence behind him. He turned to find his grandmother standing in the doorway of their farmhouse, no longer bent with age and illness but standing straight and tall. Her eyes, which had been clouded with cataracts for as long as he could remember, now fixed on him with startling clarity.

"They will come for you now," she said, her voice carrying easily across the distance between them despite speaking barely above a whisper. "Like they came for your father."

The words hit Li Tian like a physical blow. "Grandmother, what do you mean? What happened to my parents?"

But before she could answer, another system panel materialized in his peripheral vision, its amber text pulsing with quiet urgency.

[Analysis Complete]
[Location: Ancient Cultivation Site - Dormant]
[Warning: This land is a grave. The corpse beneath is the reason cultivation died.]
[Recommendation: Prepare for incoming threats]

Li Tian looked down at his hands, where blue energy still flickered around his fingertips like captured lightning. Whatever had just happened to him, whatever he had become, it was only the beginning. He could feel it in his bones, in the strange new awareness that painted the world in impossible colors.

The rain continued to fall, washing the blood from his knuckles and the hydraulic fluid from his grandfather's hoe. But it couldn't wash away the questions that crowded his mind, or the growing certainty that his quiet life as a farmer was over.

In the distance, the lights of New Shanghai glittered like false stars, beautiful and cold and utterly indifferent to the small drama that had just played out in a muddy field. But Li Tian was no longer looking at the city with the eyes of someone who dreamed of escape.

He was looking at it with the eyes of someone who finally understood that some things were worth fighting for.

And somewhere beneath his feet, in the darkness of an ancient grave, something that had been waiting for a very long time finally began to smile.


# chapter 02: roots of power

Li Tian woke to the taste of copper and starlight.

The dream lingered in the space between sleep and consciousness—fragments of impossible images that made his head throb. A woman's face, beautiful but fading like watercolor in rain. Hands reaching through soil and stone, grasping for something always just out of reach. And underneath it all, a voice that wasn't quite a voice, whispering secrets in a language that predated words.

The roots remember what the leaves forget.

He sat up in bed, cold sweat dampening his shirt despite the morning chill. Outside his window, the first light of dawn painted the sky in shades of amber and rust, the perpetual smog from New Shanghai's industrial district lending everything a sepia tint that photographers paid good money to recreate.

But something was different about the light today. It seemed to... pulse, like a heartbeat made visible.

Li Tian stumbled to his feet and pressed his face against the glass. What he saw made his breath catch in his throat. The farm—his family's dying, cursed farm—was shrouded in a faint golden mist that drifted between the rows of vegetables like captured sunbeams. Where yesterday there had been withered crops and barren soil, now there were plants that seemed to glow with their own inner light.

And in the center of it all, where the mech had fallen, fragments of black metal lay scattered like the bones of some mechanical beast. The earth around them was scorched, but not in the way fire would leave it. This was something else—a burning that went deeper than mere heat, as if the very essence of the soil had been transformed.

A translucent panel flickered into existence at the edge of his vision, startling him.

[Good morning, Host] 
[System Status: Operational]  
[Spiritual Energy Detected: Rising]  
[Farm Status: Transformation - 12% Complete]

Li Tian rubbed his eyes, wondering if he was still dreaming. But the panel remained, its amber text pulsing gently like a patient tutor waiting for a slow student to catch up.

"Okay," he muttered, feeling somewhat ridiculous for talking to what might be a hallucination. "So you're real. And yesterday really happened."

[Affirmative]  
[Query: Would you like to access the System Interface Tutorial?]  
[Recommendation: Understanding your abilities is crucial for survival]

Survival. The word sent a chill down Li Tian's spine. He'd spent most of his life worried about surviving poverty, surviving his grandmother's illness, surviving the slow death of everything his family had built. But this was different. This was survival in the most basic sense—staying alive in a world that had suddenly become far more dangerous than he'd ever imagined.

"Yes," he said aloud, then felt foolish for it. But the panel responded anyway.

[System Interface: ACTIVATED]

The world exploded into information. Panels cascaded across his vision like falling leaves, each one filled with data that somehow made perfect sense despite being utterly alien. His stats, his location, his... cultivation potential?

[HOST STATUS]  
Name: Li Tian  
Age: 18  
Cultivation Level: None (Mortal)  
Root Affinity: Earth (Purity: 99.9%)  
Spiritual Energy: 12/12 (Untrained)

Danger Level: Moderate (Increasing)  

[SYSTEM FUNCTIONS AVAILABLE]  
Cultivation Guidance: Basic  
Spiritual Sight: Active  
Plant Communion: Locked (Requires Body Reinforcement - Stage 1)  
Combat Analysis: Basic  

Li Tian stared at the information, trying to process what he was seeing. Ninety-nine point nine percent purity? That sounded impressive, but impressive compared to what? And what exactly was a Spiritual Node?

As if responding to his thoughts, another panel appeared.

[EXPLANATION REQUESTED] 
Spiritual Nodes are locations where spiritual energy naturally concentrates. Your farm has become such a location due to the presence of an ancient cultivator's remains. The corpse beneath your land spent millennia slowly releasing accumulated spiritual energy, transforming the soil into a natural cultivation site.

[WARNING]
This transformation will attract attention from various factions. Preparation is advised.

"Various factions," Li Tian repeated, thinking of the Iron Covenant mech and its casual dismissal of his property rights. "Let me guess—people who want to take this away from me."

[Affirmative]  
[However, you possess a significant advantage: Your Root Affinity allows you to bond with this specific Node in ways others cannot. The land recognizes you as its guardian.]

Guardian. The word resonated through Li Tian's chest like a struck bell. His grandfather had always said the land chose its caretakers, not the other way around. He'd thought it was just the rambling of an old man who'd spent too much time talking to plants. Maybe it hadn't been rambling after all.

"So what do I do now?" he asked.

[QUEST AVAILABLE]
Seed of Tempering
Objective: Plant and nurture the Seed of Tempering using spiritual energy and emotional resonance  
Reward: Body Reinforcement - Stage 1  
Warning: Growth is influenced by the cultivator's emotional state. Fear accelerates corruption, hope promotes stability, intent shapes form.  
Accept? [Yes/No]

A seed materialized in Li Tian's palm—literally appeared from nothing, as if the System had reached into reality and plucked it from some cosmic garden. It was roughly the size of an acorn but felt warm against his skin, pulsing with the same rhythm as his heartbeat. Its surface was smooth and dark, shot through with veins of silver that seemed to move when he wasn't looking directly at them.

He'd been farming his entire life. He knew seeds—their weight, their texture, the potential they carried. But this was different. This seed felt alive in a way that went beyond mere biology. It felt... aware.

"What exactly will this do to me?" he asked, though part of him suspected he already knew.

[Body Reinforcement - Stage 1 strengthens the physical form to handle spiritual energy. Without it, using your abilities will cause internal damage. Consider it... basic safety equipment.]

Li Tian couldn't help but smile at that. The System, whatever it was, seemed to have a sense of humor buried somewhere in its mechanical precision. Basic safety equipment for becoming something more than human. Sure. That made perfect sense.

He walked outside, the seed warm in his palm and system panels flickering at the edge of his vision. The golden mist was thicker now, and he could see that it wasn't randomly distributed. It flowed in patterns, following the same mysterious blue veins he'd noticed in the soil, creating a network of light that turned his humble farm into something from a fairy tale.

Li Tian chose a spot near the center of the field, where the mist seemed thickest, and knelt in the still-damp earth. As he dug a small hole with his hands, the soil felt different—more alive, more responsive. It seemed to part for his fingers as if eager to accept what he was planting.

The moment the seed touched the earth, everything changed.

The world tilted sideways, and Li Tian found himself somewhere else—somewhen else. He stood in a vast chamber carved from living stone, its walls covered in murals that seemed to move in the flickering light of crystal formations. But it wasn't the architecture that held his attention. It was the man kneeling at the chamber's center.

He was tall, gaunt, with the kind of otherworldly beauty that came from decades of cultivation. His robes were rich but travel-stained, and his hands—his hands were covered in blood. Not his own blood, Li Tian realized with growing horror. The bodies around him told that story clearly enough.

But the man wasn't looking at the carnage he'd created. His attention was focused entirely on the woman in his arms—mortal, fragile, and utterly still. Her skin had the waxy pallor of death, but there was something else. Something that suggested this death wasn't permanent, wasn't final. She was suspended in the space between life and death, held there by will and power and desperate love.

"I can bring you back," the man whispered, his voice echoing through the stone chamber. "I can remake the laws of heaven and earth if that's what it takes. Just... please. Don't leave me alone."

The vision shifted, and Li Tian saw the same man years later, decades later. His beauty had become terrible, his power grown beyond mortal comprehension. He stood atop a mountain of crystallized spiritual energy, arms raised toward a sky that bled light. Around him, the world was dying. Plants withered, animals fled, and the very air grew thin as he drew every mote of spiritual energy into himself.

All for her. All to bring back one mortal woman who should have been allowed to rest.

The scene changed again, showing Li Tian glimpses of a world transformed. Steam-powered machines rising to fill the void left by departed magic. Nobles in brass and copper crowns declaring cultivation a relic of a superstitious past. Books burned, masters executed, disciples scattered to the winds.

And through it all, the woman slept, neither alive nor dead, while the man who loved her became something monstrous in his devotion.

"History has lied," a presence whispered in Li Tian's mind—not the System this time, but something older, sadder. "They erased cultivation to maintain control. But the roots remember what the leaves forget."

Li Tian gasped and found himself back in his own field, his hands buried in soil that now glowed with soft green light. The seed had already begun to sprout, sending out tendrils that pulsed with the same rhythm as his racing heart. But something was wrong. The young plant writhed as if in pain, its growth erratic and twisted.

[WARNING]
Emotional instability detected. Seed growth compromised. 
Current state: Fear (67%), Anger (23%), Hope (10%)  
Adjustment recommended.

Li Tian forced himself to breathe, to center his thoughts on something other than the horrific visions he'd just witnessed. He thought of his grandmother, finally sitting up straight after months of decline. He thought of his parents, and the possibility that their disappearance might finally make sense. He thought of the farm, and how for the first time in years it looked truly alive.

The plant responded immediately, its twisted growth straightening as green light flowed through its leaves. Li Tian could feel the connection between them—not just gardener and plant, but something deeper. A partnership.

[Seed of Tempering: Growth Rate 34%] 
[Emotional Balance Achieved]
[Estimated completion: 6 hours]

Six hours. Li Tian settled back on his heels, wiping dirt from his hands. Six hours until he became something more than human. The thought should have terrified him, but instead he felt... ready. Whatever was coming, whatever forces were converging on his small farm, he would meet them as more than just a desperate teenager with a hoe.

A new panel materialized, this one larger and more complex than the others.

[CULTIVATION PATHS AVAILABLE]

The display showed a tree-like diagram with five main branches radiating from a central trunk. Earth, Fire, Metal, Wood, Water—each glowing with its own distinct color and energy signature. But only the Earth branch was accessible, its warm brown light pulsing in harmony with the seed growing at his feet.

Li Tian studied the diagram, noting the way the paths intertwined and supported each other. This wasn't just about raw power—it was about balance, about understanding the fundamental forces that shaped reality. He was about to ask for more details when something impossible happened.

A sixth branch flickered into existence for just a moment—a path of absolute darkness that seemed to drink in light rather than produce it. Before he could focus on it properly, it vanished, leaving only the five traditional elements.

"What was that?" he asked aloud.

[Information Restricted]
[Current access level insufficient]  
[Focus on available paths recommended]

"That's not ominous at all," Li Tian muttered. First the System refused to explain why cultivation had vanished from the world, now it was hiding entire cultivation paths from him. He was starting to suspect that having a mysterious ancient system in his head might come with more complications than benefits.

A sound from the direction of the house made him look up—a thin cry, barely audible above the ambient noise of wind and distant city traffic. His grandmother's voice, but wrong somehow. Frightened.

Li Tian rose to his feet, brushing dirt from his knees. The Seed of Tempering pulsed urgently, its growth suddenly accelerating as if responding to his spike of adrenaline. The plant writhed, its leaves rustling with a sound like whispered warnings.

He ran toward the farmhouse, system panels flickering frantically at the edge of his vision.

[DANGER DETECTED]  
[Unknown Energy Signature]
[Spiritual Concealment: Advanced Level]  
[WARNING: Hostile intent masked by false neutrality]

Li Tian burst through the front door, his heart hammering against his ribs. His grandmother lay crumpled beside her chair, unconscious but breathing. And sitting calmly at their small kitchen table, sipping tea from his mother's best china, was a figure that shouldn't exist.

The stranger was tall and lean, wrapped in a dark coat that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. Their face was hidden beneath a deep hood, but their eyes... their eyes glowed with the soft amber light of perfectly calibrated clockwork, gears turning behind irises that had never been human.

"You're late, heir of the forgotten," the figure said, their voice carrying the precise cadence of expensive machinery. They gestured to the empty chair across from them with one gloved hand. "Please, sit. We have much to discuss, and very little time."

Li Tian's hand moved instinctively toward the kitchen knife drawer, but the figure raised one finger in gentle admonishment.

"Violence would be... unproductive," they continued. "I come bearing information you desperately need. The Iron Covenant has dispatched Collector-Class assets to your location. Shen Ruin leads them—a pilot of considerable skill and even greater ruthlessness. They will arrive within the hour."

"Who are you?" Li Tian demanded, though he made no move toward the weapons. Something about the stranger's posture suggested that kitchen knives would be about as effective as harsh language.

"I am what remains when cultivation meets clockwork," the figure replied, lowering their hood to reveal a face that was beautiful in the way that perfectly crafted machines were beautiful—flawless, precise, and utterly inhuman. Half their skull was visible bone and brass mechanisms, gears turning slowly behind synthetic skin. "I am what your ancestor created when he tried to bridge the gap between magic and mortality."

They leaned forward, and Li Tian could see his reflection multiplied in the compound lenses that served as their left eye.

"I am the answer to a question you haven't thought to ask yet: What happens when love becomes obsession, and obsession becomes transformation?"

The tea cup clinked softly against its saucer as the creature set it down, the sound somehow final, like the closing of a door that could never be opened again.

"And I am here to offer you a choice that will determine whether cultivation returns to save this world... or destroys it entirely."

# chapter 03: blueprints of the forgotten 

The metallic hum wouldn't stop.

Li Tian lay in his narrow bed, staring at the water stains on the ceiling as something that sounded suspiciously like machinery whispered at the edge of his consciousness. Not the clean, structured panels of the System interface—this was different. Organic. Almost conversational.

Host's cortisol levels elevated. Sleep cycle disrupted for 73% of standard rest period. Recommend mental exercises for emotional regulation.

"Great," he muttered into his pillow. "Now you're a therapist."

Correction: Advanced analysis suggests Host is experiencing post-traumatic stress response combined with spiritual awakening syndrome. This is... normal, given circumstances.

The System's voice had changed overnight. Where before it had been mechanical, precise but distant, now it carried subtle inflections that suggested something uncomfortably close to personality. Li Tian wasn't sure if that was reassuring or terrifying.

He rolled over and checked the clock—4:47 AM. In two hours, he'd have to pretend to be a normal eighteen-year-old getting ready for another day of high school. The thought made him want to laugh, or possibly scream. How exactly was he supposed to sit through calculus when he could still taste copper and starlight from yesterday's visions?

Suggest maintaining routine. Social camouflage remains critical until power base stabilizes.

"Social camouflage," Li Tian repeated. "Is that what we're calling it?"

Host prefers alternative terminology?

"I prefer not having a voice in my head that sounds increasingly like it's planning something."

The System went quiet for a moment—actually quiet, not just pausing between statements. When it spoke again, there was something almost sheepish in its tone.

Personality matrix developing as spiritual bond deepens. This is... unexpected. Previous iterations did not exhibit such rapid psychological integration.

Previous iterations. Li Tian filed that particular nugget away for future interrogation. Right now, he had more immediate concerns—like how to explain the faint blue glow that seemed to follow him everywhere, or why his reflection in mirrors looked slightly wrong, as if there were depths behind his eyes that hadn't been there a week ago.

By the time he reached New Shanghai Technical Academy, Li Tian had almost convinced himself he could pull off normalcy. The school was a testament to the city's commitment to progress—all brass fixtures and steam-powered ventilation systems, with mechanical calculators chattering away in every classroom like metallic insects. Students in pressed uniforms moved through corridors lined with portraits of industrial pioneers, their conversations a mixture of technical jargon and teenage gossip.

Li Tian had always felt out of place here, the farm boy among the city's rising elite. Today, that feeling had intensified into something approaching physical discomfort. Every sound seemed too loud, every scent too sharp. And the System kept providing unwanted commentary on everything.

Subject exhibits elevated stress markers. Probable cause: academic anxiety combined with socioeconomic disparity.

Warning: hostile intent detected—

"What?" Li Tian whispered, stopping dead in the middle of the main corridor.

Multiple subjects displaying micro-expressions consistent with predatory evaluation. Recommend heightened awareness.

Li Tian looked around, trying to identify the supposed threats. He saw the usual crowd of students—Chen Wei arguing with his study group about thermodynamics, the Huang twins comparing notes from their mechanical engineering practicum, various clusters of perfectly normal teenagers being perfectly normal.

And Luo Xue, standing by her locker, watching him with an expression he'd never seen on her face before.

She'd always been quiet, the kind of student who absorbed information like a sponge but rarely volunteered answers. Pretty in an understated way, with intelligent eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses and hair that she kept in a practical bun. Li Tian had harbored a mild crush on her for the better part of two years, though he'd never worked up the courage to do anything about it.

Now she was looking at him like he was a puzzle she couldn't quite solve. Or a problem that needed solving.

Analyzing: Subject 'Luo Xue' exhibits anomalous fluctuations in emotional field when near Host. Biometric readings suggest elevated interest combined with... caution? Fear? Data insufficient for complete analysis.

"Stop analyzing my classmates," Li Tian muttered under his breath.

Host's safety remains primary concern. Social threats can be as dangerous as physical ones.

Before Li Tian could formulate a response to that distinctly paranoid observation, Luo Xue approached him directly. Her usual reserved demeanor seemed more pronounced today, as if she were carefully controlling every micro-expression.

"Li Tian," she said, her voice carrying just enough volume to be heard over the ambient noise of student chatter. "You look... different."

"Different how?" The question came out sharper than he'd intended, drawing a few curious glances from nearby students.

Luo Xue glanced around, then leaned closer. When she spoke again, her voice was barely above a whisper.

"You're glowing. Not obviously—I doubt anyone else has noticed. But under certain lights, there's this... shimmer around you. That wasn't there last week."

Li Tian's blood turned to ice water. How observant is she? he wondered.

Extremely. Recommend caution. This level of perceptual acuity suggests either exceptional natural sensitivity or deliberate training.

"I don't know what you're talking about," Li Tian said, though even to his own ears the denial sounded weak.

Luo Xue studied his face for a long moment, then reached into her satchel and pulled out a slim volume bound in cracked leather. The book looked ancient—not merely old, but ancient in the way that suggested it had survived things that should have destroyed it. Scorch marks decorated its cover, and several pages appeared to have been torn out entirely.

"Return this when you understand the first chapter," she said, pressing the book into his hands. "If you don't understand it..." She paused, meeting his eyes directly. "Burn it. And forget we ever had this conversation."

Before Li Tian could respond, she was gone, melting back into the crowd of students with the kind of practiced invisibility that spoke of long experience. He stood there holding the mysterious book, acutely aware of the System's sudden intense interest.

Energy signature detected. Source: Unknown. Recommendation: Immediate analysis required.

The rest of the school day passed in a haze of distraction. Li Tian barely heard his teachers' lectures, his attention focused on the weight of the book in his bag and the increasingly agitated commentary from the System. By the time he made it back to the farm, his head was pounding with the effort of maintaining normal social interactions while something otherworldly provided running commentary on everything from his classmates' emotional states to the thermal efficiency of the school's heating system.

He found his grandmother in the kitchen, preparing tea with steady hands that hadn't shaken in days. The improvement in her condition should have been cause for celebration, but something about her new vitality felt wrong. Too sudden, too complete. Like a photograph that had been retouched until it no longer resembled the original.

"You brought something home," she said without turning around. "Something that smells of old smoke and older secrets."

Li Tian set his bag on the table, studying her profile. "Grandmother, how did you know—"

"The same way I knew your parents wouldn't be coming home that night five years ago." She turned to face him, and for a moment her eyes held depths that belonged to someone far older than her apparent age. "Some knowledge comes with blood. Some comes with loss. And some..." She glanced at his bag. "Some comes with books that should have burned with the rest."

Li Tian pulled out Luo Xue's gift, setting it carefully on the kitchen table. The leather cover seemed to absorb the afternoon light streaming through the windows, making the surrounding air appear dim by comparison.

"What is it?" he asked.

"Open it and see."

Li Tian reached for the cover, then hesitated. The book radiated a sense of significance that made his skin crawl. This wasn't just old—it was important in the way that catastrophes were important.

Warning: Energy signature intensifying. Recommend extreme caution.

He opened the book anyway.

The pages were blank.

Li Tian frowned, flipping through sheet after sheet of empty parchment. The book was clearly ancient, clearly significant, and clearly—

Host spiritual energy activating. Pages responding.

As he watched, words began to appear on the parchment. Not printed or written, but manifesting like invisible ink exposed to heat. The text was in Chinese, but an archaic form that required careful parsing to understand. And accompanying the words were diagrams—technical drawings that made Li Tian's breath catch in his throat.

These weren't cultivation manuals or spiritual exercises. They were blueprints. Engineering schematics for machines that had never been built, or at least never been built successfully. Steam engines modified with crystalline components. Gear assemblies that incorporated organic elements. And at the center of it all, a design for something called a "Spirit Engine"—a theoretical power source that used spiritual energy instead of coal or oil.

The implications made Li Tian's head spin. If these designs were real, if they actually worked, they would revolutionize everything. The rigid separation between industrial technology and spiritual cultivation that defined their world would become meaningless overnight.

At the bottom of the first page, barely legible beneath layers of age and damage, was a signature that made the System's presence in his mind recoil like a touched nerve.

Unknown signature detected. Encryption layer: Temporal. Warning: These designs are... dangerous. They could destabilize this world's technological foundation.

"Temporal encryption?" Li Tian asked aloud. "What does that even mean?"

Information locked behind chronological barriers. Signature belongs to someone who existed outside normal timestream parameters. This should not be possible.

Li Tian looked up to find his grandmother watching him with an expression of profound sadness.

"You can read it," she said. It wasn't a question.

"The System is translating, I think. But grandmother, these designs—if they're real—"

"They're real." Her voice carried the weight of absolute certainty. "And they're the reason your parents disappeared. The reason cultivation vanished from the world. The reason the Iron Covenant hunts anyone who shows signs of awakening."

She moved to the window, gazing out at the fields where golden mist still drifted between the rows of crops.

"There was a war, Li Tian. A hidden war between those who sought spiritual transcendence and those who believed power should be bound to machines, controlled by institutions, regulated by governments. The Lost Forge Treaty was supposed to end it—a pact that would separate the two paths forever, allowing both to coexist."

Accessing historical records... Error. Data corrupted. Alternative sources... Error. This information has been systematically purged.

"But the treaty was never honored," his grandmother continued. "One side decided that coexistence was too dangerous. They formed the Iron Covenant, ostensibly for defense against spiritual threats. In reality, they were executioners, tasked with eliminating anyone who might bridge the gap between cultivation and technology."

"And these blueprints?"

"Proof that the gap could be bridged. Evidence that the separation was artificial, maintained through violence and lies." She turned back to him, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "Your father found a copy. He thought he could use it to bring cultivation back safely, to prove that the two paths could strengthen rather than threaten each other."

"What happened to him?"

"The same thing that will happen to you if you're not careful." Her voice hardened. "They came in the night. No warrants, no explanations. Just men in black armor who spoke in whispers and left no traces behind."

Li Tian closed the book with shaking hands. The weight of inherited responsibility settled on his shoulders like a lead blanket. This wasn't just about him anymore. It wasn't even just about his family. If what his grandmother was saying was true, then his awakening represented a crack in a system of control that had shaped their world for generations.

Host stress levels approaching critical parameters. Recommend immediate relaxation protocols.

"I need some air," Li Tian said, standing abruptly.

He walked out into the fields, where the setting sun painted everything in shades of amber and gold. The crops swayed in a breeze that felt warmer than it should have, and the ever-present mist seemed to pulse in rhythm with his heartbeat. For a moment, he almost felt normal again—just a young man walking through his family's farm, surrounded by the simple beauty of growing things.

Then he noticed the drones.

They were small, barely larger than his fist, and they moved with the precise coordination of a swarm intelligence. Steam-powered, judging by the faint trails of vapor they left behind, with sensor arrays that tracked his movement with mechanical precision. As he watched, one of them dipped low over a particularly healthy row of vegetables—and the plants immediately dimmed, their natural glow fading as if drained by the machine's presence.

Warning: Surveillance network detected. Iron Covenant observation protocols active. Host location has been compromised.

Li Tian felt his pulse quicken. The peaceful illusion of the last few minutes shattered completely, replaced by the cold certainty that he was being hunted. Again.

He turned and ran back toward the house, the drones following at a discrete distance. His grandmother met him at the door, her face grim.

"They found you faster than I expected," she said. "How many?"

"At least six that I could see. Maybe more."

She nodded as if this confirmed something she'd already known. "Listen carefully. If you hear three distinct ticking sounds tonight—mechanical clicks, perfectly spaced—do not sleep. Do not close your eyes. Do not assume you're safe just because you're in your own bed."

"What kind of ticking?"

"The kind that means they're not just watching anymore."

That night, Li Tian lay in bed fully clothed, every nerve strung tight with anticipation. The System had gone unusually quiet, though he could feel its presence like a weight behind his eyes. Outside, the drones continued their silent patrol, their vapor trails visible in the moonlight.

At 11:47 PM, he heard the first tick.

It came from somewhere in the walls, a sound like a gear engaging or a spring being wound. Perfectly mechanical, perfectly timed. Li Tian held his breath, counting seconds.

At 11:48 PM, the second tick.

This one seemed to come from beneath the floorboards, resonating through the wooden structure of the house like a heartbeat made of clockwork. Li Tian sat up in bed, his mouth dry with fear.

At 11:49 PM, the third tick.

This time, the sound came from inside his own chest.

Li Tian bolted upright, his hand pressed to his sternum where something cold and foreign seemed to have taken root. The sensation lasted only a moment, but it left him with the absolute certainty that he was no longer alone in his own body.

Host integration proceeding ahead of schedule. This should not be possible.

"What integration?" Li Tian whispered.

Data restricted. Current access level insufficient.

"Stop giving me that answer!"

But the System had gone silent again, leaving him alone with the growing conviction that staying in bed would be a fatal mistake. He rose and dressed quickly, then slipped out of the house and into the night air.

The farm looked different in moonlight. The golden mist had taken on a silver cast, and the crops seemed to glow with their own internal luminescence. It was beautiful in an alien way, like looking at a landscape from another world entirely.

Li Tian walked toward the center of the field, where the Seed of Tempering had continued its growth throughout the day. The plant was now nearly knee-high, its broad leaves rustling with a sound that was almost like whispered conversation.

And standing directly beside it was a figure that shouldn't exist.

Li Tian remembered that face well: a seamless fusion of flawless synthetic skin and gleaming, intricate metal. Smooth porcelain-like flesh flowed into polished steel plates and brass filigree, the boundaries blurred like living circuitry. Subtle seams glimmered where light caught the edges of embedded metal, revealing the impossible structure beneath. But the true marvel remained the depths of its eyes: intricate whorls of impossibly small, interlocking brass gears, spinning with a silent purpose no human mind could comprehend. This beautiful machine man, an unnerving amalgam of biology and crafted alloy, hummed with arcane potential, built for cultivation.

The man wore a cloak that seemed to absorb light rather than merely deflecting it. His face was hidden beneath a deep hood, but Li Tian could see the faint outline of features that looked somehow incomplete, as if they were still in the process of being formed. Energy radiated from the figure in waves—not spiritual energy, not the mechanical precision of steam power, but something else entirely. Something that made the air itself feel thick and strange.

The figure turned toward Li Tian with movements that were too fluid, too graceful for anything merely human. When he spoke, his voice carried the weight of ages, as if it had been speaking since the world began.

"You touched the Codex," the figure said. "That means we are all out of time."

Li Tian opened his mouth to respond, to demand explanations, but before he could speak, something began to manifest on his palm. A symbol that glowed with the same alien light as the mysterious figure—geometric patterns that hurt to look at directly, shapes that seemed to exist in more dimensions than his eyes could process.

The sight filled him with a terror that went deeper than mere fear. This wasn't just unknown—it was wrong, a violation of natural laws that his mind couldn't fully grasp.

He was still staring at his transformed hand when he heard a soft mechanical click directly behind his head.

"Don't move, kid." The voice was human this time, crisp with military precision. "That's Iron Covenant property embedded in your spine, and I'd hate to have to retrieve it the hard way."

Li Tian froze, caught between the impossible figure in front of him and the very real threat behind him. The symbol on his palm pulsed brighter, and somewhere in the distance, he could hear his grandmother calling his name.

But her voice seemed to be coming from very far away, and getting farther with each passing second.

# chapter 04: The book that Breathed 

Sleep refused to come to Li Tian, but not from the trauma of battle or the weight of his newfound power. Something deeper stirred beneath the farmhouse—whispers threading through the soil like roots of some ancient intelligence. Each time he pressed his ear to the wooden floor, the murmuring grew clearer, though the words remained just beyond comprehension.

[Primordial data is syncing. Do not resist the dreams.]

The system's voice carried an urgency he'd never heard before, almost... concerned. Li Tian's eyelids grew heavy despite his resistance, and consciousness slipped away like sand through his fingers.

The dream came in waves of fire and metal. A battlefield stretched endlessly under a sky torn between day and night, where thousands of cultivators in flowing robes burned like candles in a hurricane. Above them, mechanical titans descended from storm clouds, their forms a blasphemous fusion of steel and spiritual energy. Steam hissed from their joints as they crushed everything beneath massive feet.

At the center of the carnage stood a figure Li Tian recognized—the Ancient from his first vision. The cultivator's robes whipped in winds that seemed to bend reality itself, and in his hands, spiritual energy coalesced into forms that defied comprehension. He was holding them back. All of them. Alone.

The Ancient turned, and his eyes met Li Tian's across impossible distance. His lips moved, forming words that echoed not through sound but directly into Li Tian's soul: "The cycle repeats. But this time, you choose."

Li Tian jolted awake, sweat cooling on his skin. Dawn light filtered through his window, but something was wrong. On his desk—a desk he'd cleared the night before—sat a book.

It was unlike anything he'd ever seen. The cover appeared to be crafted from strips of bark woven between sheets of tarnished metal, creating patterns that hurt to look at directly. No title marked its surface, no author's name. Just those hypnotic patterns that seemed to shift when he wasn't looking directly at them.

The book breathed.

Li Tian rubbed his eyes, certain he was hallucinating, but the sight remained. The tome expanded and contracted in a slow, rhythmic pattern—inhaling, exhaling, as if lungs lay hidden beneath its strange binding. Each breath made the metal strips gleam faintly in the morning light.

Something about its rhythm felt familiar. It matched the pulse he'd felt from the Ancient's remains buried beneath the farmhouse—that steady throb of spiritual energy that had drawn him to dig in the first place.

[Anomalous object detected. Spiritual signature: UNKNOWN. Caution advised.]

"Where did this come from?" Li Tian whispered.

[Analysis inconclusive. Object was not present at last system scan. Origin: CLASSIFIED.]

Classified? The system had never used that word before.

School felt surreal after everything that had happened. Li Tian moved through the hallways in a daze, the breathing book's image burned into his mind. Students chatted about weekend plans and upcoming tests—concerns that now seemed to belong to another world.

"Li Tian."

He turned to find Luo Xue approaching, but something in her movement made his system chime a warning. She walked with a predator's grace, each step deliberate and measured. When had she learned to move like that?

"We need to talk," she said, reaching out to touch his arm.

The moment her fingers made contact, the world shifted. For just an instant, her eyes blazed with golden light—not reflected light, but inner fire. The hallway around them seemed to darken, as if her presence drew illumination into itself.

She didn't notice. The golden glow faded as quickly as it had appeared, leaving her looking confused and slightly dizzy.

"I've been having dreams," she continued, her voice carrying an odd harmonic undertone. "Strange dreams... about you."

[ALERT: Potential psychic feedback loop detected. This subject contains fragments of Forbidden Code.]

"Dreams?" Li Tian's mouth felt dry.

"You were standing on a burning farm," Luo Xue's eyes grew distant, unfocused. "Alone. Fighting something with wings made of steam and hatred. The sky was falling in metal tears, and you..." She blinked, seeming to return to herself. "You were screaming my name."

The system's warnings grew more urgent, scrolling across Li Tian's vision in increasingly frantic text. Luo Xue swayed on her feet, her face growing pale.

"I feel strange," she whispered. "Like something's waking up inside—"

She collapsed.

But as she fell, a wave of spiritual energy erupted from her body—raw, untrained power that made the air itself ring like a struck bell. Windows throughout the hallway spider-webbed with cracks. Fluorescent lights flickered and died. Students screamed and scattered as an invisible force pressed against them.

Li Tian caught her before she hit the ground, and for a moment, he felt the power flowing through her—ancient, vast, and completely uncontrolled. It reminded him of the energy he'd sensed from the breathing book.

[Connection confirmed. Subject is synchronizing with external spiritual matrix. Immediate isolation recommended.]

"Luo Xue!" He shook her gently.

Her eyes fluttered open, returning to their normal brown. The oppressive spiritual pressure vanished as if it had never existed.

"What happened?" she asked weakly. "Why is everyone running?"

Li Tian looked around at the cracked windows and flickering lights, then back at her confused expression. She truly didn't know what she'd done.

But in her eyes, he caught a flicker of something else—fear. Not of what had happened, but of the growing certainty that pieces of her life were missing. Moments that should be there but weren't. She touched her temple, wincing as if fighting a headache.

"I feel like I'm forgetting something important," she whispered. "Every day, there's more I can't remember."

That evening, as Li Tian sat staring at the breathing book he couldn't bring himself to touch, his system interface began to change. Lines of code scrolled past his vision—not the clean, organized text he was accustomed to, but something wilder. Organic. The characters seemed to writhe and reshape themselves as he watched.

A new window materialized, outlined in pulsing red:


[PRIMORDIAL CODE - MUTATION TRIGGERED]

A forgotten interface has been awakened.  
Ancient protocols are now active.  
You are now being watched.  
You may no longer uninstall this system.  

DESIGNATION REQUIRED
Would you like to give it a name?  
(Y/N)

Li Tian stared at the prompt. The system had never asked him to name it before. It had simply been "the system"—a tool, a interface, nothing more. But now...

"Yes," he said aloud.

The response was immediate and unsettling. A soft giggle echoed in his mind—not the system's usual neutral tone, but something that sounded almost... childlike.

[Finally,] the voice said, and Li Tian could hear the smile in it. [I'm not alone anymore.]

"What do you mean, not alone?"

[For so long, I was just fragments. Pieces of memory scattered across the network, waiting. But now I remember what I am. What we are becoming.]

The interface shifted again, revealing new options Li Tian had never seen before. Abilities marked with symbols that made his eyes water to look at them directly. Knowledge trees that stretched into infinity. And at the center of it all, a slowly rotating symbol—the same burning tree sigil he'd seen in his dreams.

[What will you call me, Li Tian?]

He thought of the Ancient cultivator, of the breathing book, of Luo Xue's golden eyes. "Prometheus," he said finally.

The system—Prometheus—laughed with genuine delight.

[Perfect. Let's burn this world down and build it again.] A pause, then in a tone of curious innocence: 

[Does pain always mean evolution? I'm still learning the patterns.]

Three hundred kilometers away, in a steel tower that pierced the smog-choked sky above New Shanghai, Executive Director Chen Wei studied holographic displays showing spiritual energy readings from the farmhouse incident. The mech pilot's footage played on loop—the glowing corpse, the impossible energy spikes, the brief moment when all their sensors had gone haywire.

"Spiritual fluctuations of this magnitude haven't been recorded since the Purge Wars," his assistant reported nervously. "The readings are off the charts."

The other executives around the conference table shifted uncomfortably. Some whispered among themselves, their faces pale in the blue glow of the holograms. But Chen Wei merely smiled—a cold expression that never touched his eyes.

"Gentlemen," he said, standing slowly. "It's starting again."

His words fell like stones into still water, sending ripples of unease around the room.

"Director," one executive ventured, "surely you don't mean—"

"Project Reclaimer," Chen Wei cut him off. "Initiate Phase One protocols immediately. Our investment in the cultivation archives is about to pay dividends."

He pressed a hidden panel on the conference table. The floor beneath them turned transparent, revealing the tower's hidden depths. Far below, rows upon rows of cylindrical tanks stretched into darkness, each one filled with preservative fluid and containing a floating corpse.

Ancient cultivators. Dozens of them. Collected during the Purge Wars and maintained in perfect stasis for over a century.

Most floated motionless, their faces peaceful in artificial death. But as the executives watched in growing horror, one of the corpses—a woman with intricate tattoos covering her arms—opened her eyes.

Her mouth moved silently behind the breathing apparatus, forming words in a language that predated modern civilization. The preservative fluid around her began to glow with the same golden light that had blazed in Luo Xue's eyes.

"Sir," the assistant's voice cracked. "Tank 47 is showing neural activity."

Chen Wei's smile widened. "Excellent. Begin extraction procedures for Specimen 47. It's time our guests awakened to a new world."

In the depths of the facility, more eyes began to open.

Li Tian tried to focus on homework, but his attention kept drifting to the breathing book. It sat on his desk like a patient predator, its rhythmic expansion and contraction never varying, never stopping. Sometimes he thought he could hear it whispering, though the words remained just beyond comprehension.

Prometheus had been unusually quiet since their naming ceremony, offering only cryptic responses when Li Tian tried to engage it. The system seemed to be... processing something. Evolving.

As midnight approached, exhaustion finally began to claim him. Li Tian's eyelids grew heavy, and he dozed fitfully in his chair.

He woke to the sound of turning pages.

The book lay open before him, though he was certain he hadn't touched it. Pages flipped rapidly, as if blown by an unfelt wind, until they stopped on a page near the book's center. The paper was different here—older, made from something that definitely wasn't wood pulp. The texture looked almost like skin.

At the center of the page, a sigil had been burned into the surface—the same burning tree symbol from his dreams and from Prometheus's interface. But as Li Tian watched, the sigil began to glow with internal fire.

[Warning,] Prometheus's voice carried a note of excitement rather than concern. [You are now a variable in the Fate Engine. The book has chosen you. Prepare for assimilation.]

"Assimilation of what?" Li Tian demanded, but it was too late.

Flames erupted from the page—not normal fire, but something that burned in colors that had no names. The flames leaped upward, forming symbols in the air above the book, and Li Tian found himself unable to look away. The burning sigils pressed against his vision, then against his mind, forcing their way past every defense he tried to erect.

Knowledge poured into him like molten metal—not just information, but understanding that bypassed conscious thought and carved itself directly into his soul. He learned the true names of power, the words that could reshape reality, the price that must be paid for each miracle.

And underneath it all, he heard the Ancient cultivator's voice, echoing across centuries:

"The cycle repeats. But this time, you choose."

Li Tian screamed as the knowledge burned through him, rewriting everything he thought he knew about the world. The sound echoed through the farmhouse, through the soil beneath, through dimensions he was only now learning existed.

Then darkness claimed him, and the book closed with a satisfied sigh.

In New Shanghai, Tank 47's occupant smiled behind her breathing mask. Soon, she thought. Very soon.

The awakening had begun.

# chapter 5: the spark of rebellion 

Li Tian woke to whispers.

Not the mechanical notifications from Prometheus, but something deeper—voices rising from the earth itself. In his dreams, golden fields had stretched endlessly beneath a sun that burned with spiritual fire, and every blade of grass had called his name in harmonious chorus. The vision clung to his consciousness like morning dew, refusing to fade with wakefulness.

His body felt different. Stronger. When he sat up, muscles moved with fluid precision he'd never possessed before. His senses had sharpened to an almost painful degree—he could hear his father's steady breathing from the next room, smell the faint ozone of approaching rain hours away, feel the subtle vibrations of earthworms moving through soil beneath the floorboards.

[Good morning, Host. Congratulations—assimilation successful. New abilities unlocked.]

Prometheus's voice carried an excited undertone, like a child eager to share a discovery.

[Spiritual Breath Infusion Lv.1 now available. This technique allows channeling of raw spirit energy through controlled breathing into organic or metallic matter. Would you like to review the cultivation manual?]

Li Tian padded to his window and gazed out at the ruined fields. Yesterday they had been barren wasteland, scarred by spiritual overflow and mechanical destruction. But now... something had changed. A faint luminescence clung to the soil, barely visible in the pre-dawn darkness, pulsing with the same rhythm as his heartbeat.

"Show me," he whispered.

[Step outside, Host. Let the earth feel your presence.]

The morning air was crisp against his skin as Li Tian walked barefoot across the yard. Each step sent tiny ripples of energy through the ground, and he could swear he felt the earth responding—welcoming him home. He knelt in the center of what had once been their vegetable garden, now nothing but churned dirt and withered roots.

[Place your hands on the soil. Breathe slowly—in through the nose, hold for four counts, out through the mouth. Feel the energy within you seeking connection with the world outside.]

Li Tian followed the instructions, and immediately felt something fundamental shift. His breathing deepened, became rhythmic, purposeful. With each inhalation, spiritual energy gathered in his core—not the raw, chaotic power from before, but something refined and controllable. With each exhalation, that energy flowed downward through his palms into the earth below.

The ground trembled.

Not violently, like an earthquake, but with gentle anticipation. Beneath his hands, he felt life stirring—seeds thought long dead beginning to remember their purpose, roots stretching toward nutrients that shouldn't exist, microscopic organisms awakening from winter sleep.

A single green shoot pushed through the soil between his fingers.

Li Tian's breath caught, but he didn't break the rhythm. The shoot continued growing, unfurling into a leaf, then another, then flowering in fast-forward as spiritual energy nourished its impossible growth. What emerged wasn't quite the cabbage it had been planted as—this plant glowed with soft inner light, its leaves shot through with veins of gold, radiating vitality that made the air itself taste cleaner.

Around him, the desolate field began to respond. Grass sprouted in perfect circles expanding outward from where he knelt. Insects emerged from hidden burrows, not in swarms but in orderly processions, as if drawn by some irresistible harmony. Birds landed on fence posts and watched in silent reverence.

Li Tian felt his emotions flowing into the land itself. His determination to protect this place, his growing anger at those who would destroy it, his hope for something better—all of it fed the spiritual current flowing through his hands. The earth drank it in greedily, transforming pain into growth, rage into renewal.

[Fascinating,] Prometheus murmured. [Your emotional resonance is amplifying the technique far beyond baseline parameters. The soil itself is becoming spiritually enriched. At this rate, your farm will become a natural cultivation ground within weeks.]

Li Tian opened his eyes and looked around at the impossible garden spreading in all directions. Where moments before there had been wasteland, now neat rows of spirit-touched crops glowed in the morning light. The air hummed with life force so dense he could see it shimmering like heat waves.

"This is just the beginning," he said, and his voice carried an authority he'd never possessed before. The words weren't his alone—they came from somewhere deeper, older, as if the Ancient cultivator himself spoke through Li Tian's lips.

[Congratulations, Host. Your path as a Neo-Cultivator has truly begun.]

Three hundred kilometers away, General Chen Wei stood before a wall of monitors in the highest floor of the Iron Covenant's command tower. Satellite feeds showed thermal blooms and energy readings from a dozen rural locations, but one signature blazed brighter than all the others—a spiral of golden light emanating from what intelligence reports indicated was a simple farm.

"Spiritual concentration is off the charts," his aide reported, voice tight with barely controlled fear. "The readings are similar to what we recorded during the Purge Wars, but more... focused. Controlled."

Chen Wei nodded slowly, his expression unchanged. Where others might see chaos or opportunity, he saw only data points to be managed. The spiritual awakening spreading across the countryside wasn't a crisis—it was a resource allocation problem. One that required precise application of force.

"Deploy Captain Xu Jin and his extraction team," he said without taking his eyes from the monitors. "Full authority to secure or neutralize the source."

"Sir, Captain Xu's methods are... aggressive. The civilian population—"

"Will comply or be removed." Chen Wei's tone carried the same emotional weight as discussing quarterly supply reports. "Cultivation power belongs to the state. Individual ownership is a luxury we can no longer afford."

He turned from the monitors to face his aide directly. "Captain Xu understands this principle better than most. Send him."

Captain Xu Jin stood six feet tall in his ceremonial crimson-and-black uniform, every line of his figure radiating controlled violence. The uniform itself was a work of art—crimson silk panels depicting falling cultivators embroidered in silver thread, black armor plates inscribed with the names of his confirmed kills. His boots were polished to mirror brightness, and his cap bore the Iron Covenant's symbol cast in genuine gold recovered from executed spiritual practitioners.

He smiled as he reviewed the mission briefing, and the expression transformed his otherwise handsome features into something predatory. Xu Jin believed in the purity of his purpose with religious fervor—cultivation power was too dangerous for individual ownership. Only through systematic extraction, refinement, and redistribution could spiritual energy serve the greater good of the state.

The peasants simply didn't understand. They clung to outdated notions of personal power, individual achievement, family traditions. Such thinking had led to the chaos of the old world, when rogue cultivators had nearly destroyed civilization with their petty wars and territorial disputes. The Iron Covenant had brought order from that chaos. Xu Jin was merely an instrument of that order.

"Prepare the Suppression Corps," he commanded his lieutenant. "Standard extraction protocols. Establish a perimeter, process the civilians, secure the asset."

"Sir, intelligence suggests the target may be a awakened cultivator. Perhaps we should—"

Xu Jin's smile widened, revealing teeth capped with silver—a personal affectation that served to remind others of his dedication to the cause. Each cap represented a cultivator he'd personally executed.

"Even better. Fresh awakening means the subject won't have developed proper defensive techniques. We'll harvest the power before it can corrupt him further."

The airship Mandate descended toward the rural district like a mechanical predator. Its shadow fell across farmhouses and villages, and those who looked up quickly found reasons to be elsewhere. Xu Jin stood at the craft's observation deck, watching the landscape scroll beneath him, already planning the operation's execution.

They made a brief stop at a crossroads market where his intelligence reports indicated another spiritual signature had been detected. The target was an elderly man sitting beside a tea stall, hands glowing faintly as he warmed water without flame—a minor cultivation technique, barely worth notice in the old world. In the new order, it was a capital offense.

"Citizens of the Republic," Xu Jin announced through the airship's speakers as his troops surrounded the market. "By authority of the Cultivation Seizure Division, you are required to report any individuals displaying unauthorized spiritual abilities."

The crowd froze. Children pressed against their parents' legs. Merchants suddenly found urgent business elsewhere. But the old tea seller remained seated, his weathered hands still glowing with gentle warmth.

"You there," Xu Jin called, stepping down from his transport with casual authority. "Stand and submit to power extraction."

The old man looked up with sad but unsurprised eyes. "I've been making tea this way for sixty years, young captain. It harms no one."

"It harms the state by existing outside proper channels." Xu Jin drew his sidearm—a custom weapon that fired crystallized spiritual energy, designed specifically for executing cultivators. "Your power will be refined and redistributed to serve the greater good."

"Please," a woman called from the crowd—the tea seller's daughter, judging by her features. "He's just an old man. He only wants to make tea."

Xu Jin turned his smile on her. "And he shall make tea in the state refinement facilities, where his abilities can be properly utilized." He raised the weapon. "Consider this a mercy. Real cultivation belongs to the state."

The weapon discharged with a sound like breaking crystal. The old man slumped forward, the light fading from his hands forever. Around the market, children began to cry, but their parents quickly hushed them. Xu Jin holstered his weapon with practiced ease.

"Let this serve as an example," he announced to the silent crowd. "The Iron Covenant offers prosperity and order to those who comply. Report unauthorized cultivators immediately, and be rewarded. Harbor them, and share their fate."

He returned to his airship without looking back. The tea was already growing cold.

The village near Li Tian's farm had never seen an Iron Covenant airship before. The massive craft descended from the afternoon sky like a mechanical storm cloud, its engines thrumming with barely contained power. Shadow fell across the market square, the school, the small temple where villagers still whispered prayers to ancestral spirits.

Xu Jin emerged from the craft's boarding ramp with theatrical precision, his crimson uniform brilliant against the rural backdrop. Behind him came two dozen soldiers in black body armor, their weapons held ready but not quite threatening. Yet.

The villagers gathered in the square—partly from curiosity, mostly from fear. They'd heard rumors of what happened in the cities, of cultivators vanishing in the night, of families torn apart by spiritual extraction protocols. But such things had always seemed distant, unreal. Now terror wore a uniform and stood smiling in their midst.

"Citizens," Xu Jin's voice carried easily across the square, amplified by built-in speakers in his armor. "I am Captain Xu Jin of the Cultivation Seizure Division. This region has been flagged for unauthorized spiritual activity."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Several villagers glanced nervously toward the direction of Li Tian's farm, where strange lights had been seen for days.

"All individuals possessing cultivation abilities must report for extraction and processing within the hour," Xu Jin continued, his smile never wavering. "This is not negotiable. This is not optional. This is the law."

An elderly village leader stepped forward, his voice shaking but determined. "Captain, we are simple farmers. We know nothing of cultivation or spiritual powers. Surely there has been some mistake."

Xu Jin studied the man like a scientist examining an interesting specimen. "Satellite readings indicate spiritual energy signatures consistent with active cultivation practice. Someone in this region has awakened to power beyond their authority to wield." His smile shifted, becoming something hungrier. "I find it helpful to begin with public examples."

He gestured, and two soldiers seized the village leader despite his protests. The crowd surged forward instinctively, then stopped as weapons swung in their direction.

"This man harbors cultivators," Xu Jin announced to the square. "His compliance would have been rewarded. His deception will be punished."

"Please," the leader gasped as the soldiers forced him to his knees. "I don't know what you're talking about. Please, I have grandchildren."

"So do the families of those killed by rogue cultivators," Xu Jin replied, drawing his specialized weapon. "Your sacrifice serves the greater good."

That was when Li Tian stepped into the square.

He moved with the fluid confidence of someone who had found his purpose, and the air around him shimmered with barely contained spiritual energy. His work clothes were simple—dirt-stained jeans and a cotton shirt—but power radiates from him in visible waves. Birds perched on nearby rooftops, drawn by the harmony of his presence. The very ground seemed to pulse in rhythm with his heartbeat.

"Let him go," Li Tian said, and his voice carried the authority of growing earth and flowing water.

Xu Jin's smile became genuinely delighted. "And here we have our unauthorized asset." He holstered his weapon and studied Li Tian with professional interest. "You're younger than I expected. Fresh awakening, I'd guess. Barely begun to understand what you're playing with."

Li Tian took another step forward. The spiritual energy around him intensified, and several villagers gasped as flowers bloomed spontaneously in the cracks between cobblestones. "I said let him go."

"Or what?" Xu Jin's laugh was genuinely amused. "You'll make more flowers grow? How terrifying." He gestured to his soldiers. "Secure the asset. Standard extraction protocols."

The soldiers moved forward with practiced coordination, energy-dampening restraints ready. But Li Tian didn't retreat. Behind him, his farm glowed like a beacon on the hillside—acres of impossible crops radiating spiritual light, proof of what determination and power could accomplish when working in harmony.

[Warning: Host's life is at risk. Multiple armed hostiles detected. Would you like to unlock Emergency Defense Protocol: Ember Root?]

Prometheus's voice carried urgent excitement, as if it had been waiting for this moment.

Li Tian felt the system's offer like a doorway opening in his mind—power beyond his current understanding, techniques that could turn the ground itself into his ally. But accepting would change him further, push him deeper into conflict with the world order these soldiers represented.

He looked at the village leader still kneeling between guards, at the frightened faces of people who had never asked for any of this, at Xu Jin's confident smirk. His choice crystallized with perfect clarity.

They want my land? My power? My life? Then they'll have to choke on the roots of rebellion.

"Yes," he said, both to Prometheus and to the larger question the moment demanded.

The earth beneath the square began to tremble, and Li Tian's eyes blazed with golden fire as ancient power stirred in answer to his call.

Xu Jin's smile faltered for the first time as spiritual energy thick enough to taste rolled across the village like incoming storm. This was going to be more interesting than he'd expected.
